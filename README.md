# TD-Monogram
Touchdesigner Monogram Creative Console Integration

This is a small TD component for as deep integration as possible without SDK of the [Monogram Creative Console](https://monogramcc.com/) - Studio console with additional Faders module.

The studio package contains:
1. 1x Core module
2. 1x Orbiter
3. 2x Dial
4. 1x Slider (additional)
5. 1x Essential Keys

My integration contains following feature:
  - Hi Resolution mappings - midi resolution 0..127 was augmented and normalized to 0..1 floats
  - Ready custom made profile for Monogram Creator configuration software that you can save through the COMP interface
  - Debug indicators: midi and joystick connection status and dialog buttons to correct it

Created in 2021.16270 version of Touchdesigner, but it uses only standard componenent and scripting excerpt binding functionality.

You are welcome to modify and to distribute this component or to expand its functionnality. 

I hope you find it useful.
